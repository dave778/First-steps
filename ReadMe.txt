Just trying to learn some CSS and JS

This is my first attempt at a rock scissors paper game following the tutorial at https://youtu.be/jaVNP3nIAv0

Thisis also my first project using Git. 

Known issues. 

I am unable to seperate all three of the images for rock, scissors, and paper. When one clicks on the paper icon, there are three outcomes at once. 



Any help is welcome.
